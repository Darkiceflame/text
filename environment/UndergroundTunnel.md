#Underground Tunnel

Type: Room

## Description

The trapdoor leads you down into a dark tunnel. You have to squint in the gloom as you try to make out your surroundings.

The tunnel seems rather unremarkable on its own. There are two branches extending outward, one to the north and one to the south.

As you step off the ladder leading to the ground, you hear a loud thud. The trapdoor has closed behind you. There is no way to open it from beneath.

You now have no choice but to take one of the two paths.
